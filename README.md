# GEVO
We have open-sourced a dataset on the evolution of ancient characters, along with related instructions for evaluating MLLMs. The repository also includes the relevant training and evaluation code.

The relevant images for the benchmark proposed in this paper can be accessed via the link below:

Correspondingly, the instructions for evaluating MLLMs can be obtained from another link:

Additionally, we have contributed a lightweight out-of-distribution (OOD) data version, comprising approximately 150 characters in various calligraphic styles, which have undergone expert verification. Each character features a writing style distinct from that used in the Images. [**OOD Images**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXqueWlv5AYCX8lQUN6a-2VyOtOZv3Fo/view?usp=drive_link)

If you wish to use this benchmark, you may need to modify the format of the instructions based on different models and relocate the image paths contained within to your own directories.

The GEVO model will be open-sourced upon the acceptance of the paper.
